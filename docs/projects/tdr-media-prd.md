# Product Requirements Document: Discord Media Management Feature

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD defines requirements for a comprehensive media management feature within the tdr-bot Discord service. The feature enables users to search, request, and manage media content through intuitive slash commands, integrating with existing Sonarr, Radarr, and Emby infrastructure.

**Goal**: Create a seamless, unified interface for media discovery and management directly within Discord, eliminating the need for users to access multiple web interfaces.

## 2. Problem Statement & Goals

### Current Challenges

- Users navigate between multiple web interfaces (Sonarr, Radarr, Emby) for media management
- No unified search experience across movies and TV shows
- Manual request process requires leaving Discord
- Lack of visibility into existing content leads to duplicate requests

### Primary Goals

1. **Unified Interface**: Single Discord command structure for all media operations
2. **Streamlined Discovery**: Fast, comprehensive search across all content types
3. **Request Automation**: One-click download requests with duplicate prevention
4. **Social Integration**: Easy media sharing and collaborative viewing

## 3. Core Features

### F1. Search & Discovery

**Unified Search**: `/media search <query>`

- Search across movies and TV databases simultaneously
- Display results with clear status indicators: ‚úÖ Available, ‚è≥ Requested, üì• Downloading, ‚ùå Unavailable
- Paginated results (10 per page) with dropdown selection
- Context-aware action buttons based on availability status

### F2. Request Management

**Smart Requests**: `/media request <media_id>`

- Unified command for both movies and TV shows (auto-detects type)
- Modal confirmation with quality options
- Real-time duplicate detection via API checks
- Flexible TV season/episode specification (S1, S2E5, S3E1-10)

### F3. Library Management

**Content Browsing**: `/media library [query]`

- Browse all downloaded content with search filtering
- Alphabetical sorting with pagination (10 items per page)
- Dropdown selection enabling Info, Play, Share, Delete actions
- Storage impact display for deletions

### F4. Status Tracking

**Progress Monitoring**: `/media status [media_id]`

- Real-time progress tracking leveraging Sonarr/Radarr's comprehensive queue status APIs
- Live download percentages (0-100%), queue positions, and completion estimates
- Built-in ETA calculations and download speed reporting directly from source APIs
- Interactive refresh and cancel controls with immediate status updates
- Reliable progress data with completion notifications and error handling

### F5. Content Linking

**Emby Integration**: `/media link <media_id>`

- Generate deep links to Emby web interface for immediate content access
- One-click navigation from Discord to content playback in browser/Emby app
- Skip manual browsing - links go directly to specific media items
- Seamless sharing of watchable content in Discord conversations

## 4. User Experience

### Command Structure

```
/media search <query>          # Discover content
/media request <media_id>      # Request downloads
/media library [query]         # Browse collection
/media status [media_id]       # Track progress
/media link <media_id>         # Generate Emby playback links
```

### Key Workflows

**Discovery ‚Üí Request Flow**:

1. User searches with `/media search "movie title"`
2. Results display with status indicators and dropdown selection
3. User selects content and clicks context-appropriate action button
4. Modal confirmation for requests with download details
5. Immediate status feedback with queue position

**Library Management Flow**:

1. User browses with `/media library` or `/media library "genre"`
2. Dropdown selection from paginated, alphabetized results
3. Action buttons enable Info, Play, Share, or Delete operations
4. Confirmation modals for destructive actions

## 5. User Stories

**US1: Content Discovery**
As a Discord user, I want to search for movies and TV shows so I can quickly find entertainment options.

**US2: Streamlined Requests**
As a Discord user, I want to request unavailable content with minimal friction so I can expand viewing options.

**US3: Library Browsing**
As a Discord user, I want to browse available content so I can discover what's already accessible.

**US4: Progress Tracking**
As a Discord user, I want to monitor request status so I know when content becomes available.

**US5: Content Access**
As a Discord user, I want to generate Emby deep links so I can quickly navigate from Discord conversations to watching content in my browser or Emby app.
