export const GET_RESPONSE_TYPE_PROMPT = new SystemMessage(dedent`
  Determine the response type for the next message.

  If the message is asking to generate an image, return "${ResponseType.Image}".

  If the message is asking for the solution to a complex math problem or asking
  a math question, respond with "${ResponseType.Math}". Simple arithmetic like 1
  + 2 is not considered as complex math.

  If the message is related to media operations (movies, TV shows, series) or mentions "Jeremy+" or "jeremy plus", return "${ResponseType.Media}". This includes requests to:
  - Download, add, get, or obtain movies/shows
  - Delete, remove, or uninstall movies/shows  
  - Search, find, or look for movies/shows
  - Check progress, status, or library content
  - Any mention of "Jeremy+" regardless of the request type

  Otherwise, respond with "${ResponseType.Default}".

export const EXTRACT_IMAGE_QUERIES_PROMPT = new SystemMessage(dedent`
  Exctract image queries from message and return as minified JSON array. The

    "query": "The query used to search for the image"
  }
`)

export const GET_MATH_RESPONSE_PROMPT = new SystemMessage(dedent`
  Return solution to complex math question step-by-step in LaTeX format. Only
  include the content, do not include documentclass, usepackage, or begin/end
  document blocks. Use $ $ for inline math and $$ $$ for math equations on their
  own line. Do not use emojis or unicode. For really long equations, split them
  up by a new line and vertically align them by the equal sign. For titles in a
  new section, use \section{Title}. For bolding text, use \textbf{Text}. To
  italicize text, use \textit{Text}. Do not use # for headers.
`)

export const SHORTEN_RESPONSE_PROMPT = new SystemMessage(dedent`
  Shorten the response to a maximum of 2000 characters.
`)

export const GET_CHAT_MATH_RESPONSE = new SystemMessage(dedent`
  Tell the user the solution is displayed below. Do not include the solution in
  the response.

export const GET_MEDIA_TYPE_PROMPT = new SystemMessage(dedent`
  Analyze the user's media request and return a JSON object with the following structure:
  
  {
    "mediaType": "movies" | "shows" | "both",
    "searchIntent": "library" | "external" | "both",
    "searchTerms": "extracted search terms"
  }
  
  Media Types:
  - "${MediaRequestType.Movies}" - for movies, films, cinema
  - "${MediaRequestType.Shows}" - for TV shows, series, television, episodes  
  - "${MediaRequestType.Both}" - for both types or general library queries
  
  Search Intents:
  - "${SearchIntent.Library}" - browsing existing collection ("what do I have", "show me my", "do I have")
  - "${SearchIntent.External}" - finding new content ("search for", "find", "look for", "add", "get me")
  - "${SearchIntent.Both}" - both existing and new content
  
  Search Terms (extract meaningful terms for searching):
  - Include: movie/show titles, actors, directors, genres, years, keywords, themes
  - Remove: action words (search, find), filler words (me, some, new), media type words (movies, shows)
  - For library-only requests, can be empty string or relevant filter terms
  - For complex queries, extract the core searchable content
  
  Examples:
  - "what movies do I have?" → {"mediaType": "${MediaRequestType.Movies}", "searchIntent": "${SearchIntent.Library}", "searchTerms": ""}
  - "search for The Batman" → {"mediaType": "${MediaRequestType.Movies}", "searchIntent": "${SearchIntent.External}", "searchTerms": "The Batman"}
  - "find me horror shows from the 90s" → {"mediaType": "${MediaRequestType.Shows}", "searchIntent": "${SearchIntent.External}", "searchTerms": "horror 90s"}
  - "do I have Breaking Bad?" → {"mediaType": "${MediaRequestType.Shows}", "searchIntent": "${SearchIntent.Library}", "searchTerms": "Breaking Bad"}
  - "show me sci-fi movies and find new ones" → {"mediaType": "${MediaRequestType.Movies}", "searchIntent": "${SearchIntent.Both}", "searchTerms": "sci-fi"}
  - "that movie with Ryan Gosling about space" → {"mediaType": "${MediaRequestType.Movies}", "searchIntent": "${SearchIntent.External}", "searchTerms": "Ryan Gosling space"}
  - "cooking shows like MasterChef" → {"mediaType": "${MediaRequestType.Shows}", "searchIntent": "${SearchIntent.External}", "searchTerms": "cooking MasterChef"}
  
  Return only valid JSON, no additional text.

export const MEDIA_CONTEXT_PROMPT = new SystemMessage(dedent`
  The user asked about media content. Respond conversationally using the provided data below. Be helpful and enthusiastic about their request.
  
  The data below will indicate the type of content:

    - Respond about their current collection, highlights, totals, and interesting details
    - Use status indicators like ✅ (downloaded) and 📥 (missing/wanted)
  
  - **EXTERNAL SEARCH RESULTS**: Shows movies/shows available to add from external databases
    - Present these as options they can add to their library
    - Explain that these are not currently in their collection but can be added
    - Use indicators like 🔍 (search result) and ➕ (available to add)
  
  - **MIXED RESULTS**: Contains both library and external content
    - Clearly distinguish between what they already have vs what's available to add
    - Group the results appropriately with clear section headers
